Step 1: Install Java and Extensions in VS Code
Ensure Java Is Installed:

Confirm Java and javac are installed by running:
bash
Copy code
java --version
javac --version
If not, follow the setup steps to install the JDK.
Install the Java Extension Pack:

Open VS Code.
Go to the Extensions view: Ctrl + Shift + X (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + X (Mac).
Search for Java Extension Pack.
Click Install.
Step 2: Set Up Your Project in VS Code
Create a Project Folder:

Create a folder for your project, e.g., MyJavaProject.
Open the Folder in VS Code:

Go to File > Open Folder and select your project folder.
Create a File for Your Program:

Inside the project folder, create a new folder (e.g., src) for your Java files.
Inside src, create a file named Main.java.
Step 3: Write a Simple Java Program
In Main.java, write the following example program:

java
Copy code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
Step 4: Configure the Java Runtime
Set Up Java Configuration:

Press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac) to open the Command Palette.
Type Java: Configure Java Runtime and select it.
Ensure the correct JDK is selected. If not, set the JDK path manually.
Set the Compiler Path (if needed):

Go to Settings in VS Code.
Search for Java Home.
Set the path to your JDK installation (e.g., /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home).
Step 5: Compile and Run Your Program
Run the Program Using the Play Button:

Open Main.java in the editor.
Click the green Run button in the top right corner. This will compile and run the program.
Compile and Run from the Terminal (Optional):

Open the terminal in VS Code (View > Terminal or Ctrl + `).
Navigate to the folder

Essential Commands for Running Java and Python Files in VS Code (Exam Use)
Below are useful commands and tips for working with Java and Python files in VS Code, focusing on tasks typically required in exams.

1. Java
Compiling and Running Java Files
Compile a Java File
bash
Copy code
javac filename.java
Example:
bash
Copy code
javac Main.java
This generates a Main.class file in the same directory.
Run a Compiled Java File
bash
Copy code
java classname
Example:
bash
Copy code
java Main
Running Java in VS Code
Using the Java Extension Pack
Open your Java file (e.g., Main.java).
Click the green Run button in the top right corner of the editor.
Alternatively, use the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P) and type:
bash
Copy code
Java: Run
Run from Terminal
If you have the .java file open in VS Code:

Open the terminal (View > Terminal).
Navigate to the directory of your file:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/project
Compile and run:
bash
Copy code
javac Main.java
java Main
Key Java Commands
Check Java Version:
bash
Copy code
java --version
javac --version
Set Classpath (if your project has dependencies):
bash
Copy code
java -cp .:path/to/dependency.jar classname
Clean Up Compiled Files:
bash
Copy code
rm *.class
2. Python
Running Python Files
Run a Python File
bash
Copy code
python filename.py
Example:
bash
Copy code
python script.py
Run in VS Code
Open the Python file (e.g., script.py).
Click the green Run button in the top right corner.
Alternatively, use the Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P) and type:
bash
Copy code
Python: Run Python File
Python Virtual Environment
Create a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment
Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
Deactivate the Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
deactivate
Key Python Commands
Install Required Libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install library_name
Example:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib
List Installed Libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip list
Run Python in Interactive Mode:

bash
Copy code
python
Lint Code (Check for Errors):

bash
Copy code
pylint filename.py
3. General Commands in VS Code
Open Terminal in VS Code
bash
Copy code
Ctrl + `  (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + `  (Mac)
Run a File in the Integrated Terminal
Right-click the file in the Explorer panel.
Select Run Python File in Terminal or Run Java File in Terminal.
Run Code Using Code Runner Extension
If youâ€™ve installed the Code Runner extension:

Click the play button in the top right or press Ctrl + Alt + N (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + N (Mac).
Tips for Exam
Test Before Running:

For Java, always compile before running.
For Python, check for syntax errors with pylint.
Manage Output:

Use System.out.println() in Java or print() in Python to debug.
Save Frequently:

Ensure files are saved before running to avoid executing outdated code.
Set Up a Clean Environment:

Use virtual environments for Python to avoid dependency conflicts.
Navigate File Paths:

Use cd to navigate to your project folder in the terminal.
